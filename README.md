INSTRUCTIONS FOR FINANCIAL DATA COLLECTION

Project Overview:
This notice outlines the methodology employed in our recent project involving comprehensive data collection and analysis using S&P Global Market Intelligence's Capital IQ platform.

Search for a Company:
Use the search bar to find the company whose financial data you want to analyze. You can search by name, ticker symbol, or other identifiers.

Access Financials:
Once on the company's profile, navigate to the 'Financials' section, which is usually found under the 'Company Financials' tab or similar. Here you will find historical financial statements.

Select Time Range and Metrics:
Choose the time range for which you want the data (CY2016 to FY2027 for Revenue and EBITDA, CY2016 to CY2022 for COGS and R&D).
For historical data (CY2016-CY2022), you can directly access annual or quarterly reports.
For projected data (FY2023-FY2027), you may need to access analyst estimates or projections.

Extract Data:
Once the time range is selected, specify the metrics you need. You can typically find Total Revenue, EBITDA, COGS, and R&D in the Income Statement section. Use the 'Export' feature to download the data to Excel or another format if you wish to manipulate the data outside of Capital IQ.

Importance of Extensive Data Collection:
The rationale behind extensive data collection from a diverse array of financial metrics is to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of our analysis. By examining a wide range of financial indicators over multiple fiscal periods, we can identify trends, forecast future performance, and provide a robust foundation for strategic decision-making.

Creating a Comp Set

Navigate to the Screening Tool:
In Capital IQ, locate the 'Screening' tool which is designed for creating comp sets.

Select Criteria:
Define the criteria for your comp set. This might include industry classification, revenue size, geographic location, etc., to ensure the companies are comparable to your target firm.

Add Companies to Comp Set:
From the results of your screening, select the companies that you want to include in 
your comp set.
View Comp Set Financials:
After creating your comp set, go to the 'Comparables' tab where you can see the financial data for all the companies in your comp set side by side.

Customize Financial Metrics:
Customize the financial data columns to display the metrics you are interested in comparing across the set, such as Total Revenue, EBITDA, COGS, and R&D.

Save and Analyze Comp Set:
Save your comp set for future analysis. You can now use the comp set to perform ratio analysis, benchmarking, and various financial comparisons.

Exporting Comp Set Data:
Similar to individual company data, you can export the comp set data into Excel for further analysis and reporting.

Important Notes
	•	The specific navigation and options may vary slightly depending on the version of Capital IQ and the level of access your account has.
	•	Always ensure that the data is used in compliance with Capital IQ's terms of use.
	•	Some features, like accessing projections or creating comp sets, might require additional permissions or subscriptions within your Capital IQ platform.
